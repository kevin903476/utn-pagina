        <p>Ana is a smart student who loves logic and technology. Her favorite high school subjects are mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as she enjoys exploring concepts that challenge her critical thinking. She spends her free time attending programming, robotics, and 3D printing workshops, which allow her to apply her knowledge creatively. Ana also enjoys science fiction books, biographies of famous figures in technology, and films about innovation, which inspire her to imagine a future in technology.

            Ana is considering three university majors: ITI, Software Development, and Mathematics. In ITI, she sees a chance to solve real-world problems with innovative solutions but worries it may be too difficult and demanding. Software Development excites her because she dreams of creating apps and programs to help people, though she is uncertain about teamwork and personal fulfillment. Mathematics fascinates her with its precision and logic, but she is unsure about job opportunities and practical applications.
            
            To succeed in any of these careers, Ana knows she needs strong mathematical, logical, and analytical skills, as well as programming expertise and teamwork abilities. Other potential fields, such as Computer Engineering, Physics, or Statistics, could also suit her interests in logic, problem-solving, and technology.
            
            To make the best decision, Ana should research her options, talk to professionals, and create a list of pros and cons for each field. Ultimately, all three careers are great choices for someone passionate about technology, and her decision should align with her skills, interests, and long-term goals.
